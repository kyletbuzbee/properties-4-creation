# Project: Properties 4 Creations (Veteran & Family Housing)

## 🎯 Core Mission
This platform serves **Veterans and Families** in East Texas. 
* **Trust is Paramount:** Our users may be skeptical or vulnerable. The site must function flawlessly and transparently.
* **Accessibility is Mandatory:** Many users may use assistive technology. WCAG 2.1 AA is the *minimum* floor, not the ceiling.

## 👥 Audience-First UX Protocol
* **Tone:** Professional, welcoming, and direct. Avoid corporate jargon or "salesy" language. Use "Homes," "Community," and "Support" over "Units" or "Assets."
* **Visual Trust:** * Never obscure pricing or contact info.
    * Use high-contrast text (Navy on Beige/White) for maximum readability.
    * Avoid rapid animations or flashing elements (consideration for PTSD/sensory processing).
* **Navigation:** "Don't Make Me Think." Menus must be predictable. Breadcrumbs are encouraged for deep pages.

## 🎨 Design System & Accessibility
* **Primary Colors:** Navy (`#0B1120`), Wood (`#C28E5A`), Walnut (`#8B5E3C`), Beige (`#F5F1E8`).
* **Contrast Rule:** Text must *always* pass 4.5:1 contrast ratio. 
* **Focus States:** Interactive elements MUST have a visible focus ring (Outline: 3px solid `#C28E5A`).
* **Typography:** Use semantic HTML (`h1` > `h2` > `h3`) to allow screen readers to navigate the outline.

## 🚫 STRICT PROHIBITIONS
1.  **NO** "Click Here" links. Use descriptive text (e.g., "View the Tyler Ranch Floorplan").
2.  **NO** removing `skip-to-content` links. They are vital for keyboard users.
3.  **NO** committing without checking mobile responsiveness. Many families will access this solely via phone.
4.  **NO** broken forms. A failed contact form means a family doesn't get housing.
